"""
A validation script to check if your data-analysis pipeline is operating as
intended.

To test the first part of your code, run:

python -m code.test.validate pt1

To test the first two parts of your pipeline, run:

python -m code.test.validate pt2

To test all the three parts of your pipeline, run:

python -m code.test.validate pt3

while in the `code/test` folder to test the completeness of your code.

The terminal output will tell you if your pipeline is successful.
